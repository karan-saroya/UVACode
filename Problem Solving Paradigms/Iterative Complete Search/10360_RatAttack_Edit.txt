The Problem
The area of interest consists of a discrete grid of 1025 × 1025 fields. Rat exterminator scouts have given a detailed report on where rat populations of different sizes have built their nests. You are given a gas bomb with strength d and your task is to find an explosion location for this gas bomb which extinguishes the largest number of rats.
 
The best position is determined by the following criteria:
 
• The sum of all rat population sizes within the diffusion area of the gas bomb (given by d) is maximal.
 
• If there is more than one of these best positions then the location with the “minimal” position will be chosen. Positions are ordered first by their x coordinate and second by their y coordinate.
 
Formally, given a location (x1, y1) on the grid, a point (x2, y2) is within the diffusion area of a gas bomb with strength d if the following equation holds:
 
max (abs(x2 - x1), abs (y2 - y1)) <= d
Input

The first line contains the number of scenarios in the input.
 
For each scenario the first line contains the strength d of the gas bomb in the scenario (1 <= d <= 50). The second line contains the number n (1 <= n <= 20000) of rat populations. Then for every rat population follows a line containing three integers separated by spaces for the position (x, y) and “size” i of the population (1 <= i <= 255). It is guaranteed that position coordinates are valid (i.e., in the range between 0 and 1024) and no position is given more than once.


Ways to Solve :
This is an interesting problem becuase it has different ways to solve . One of the obvious ways to solve this is to traverse each of 10^6 points roughly and check a d^2 loop in that i.e a rect of length 2d.But it will hopefully exceed the required
time limit rough estimate 1024 * 1024 * 50 * 50 =25 *10^8 definite TLE :(. However if we look at it differently we can say that we are looking for the point that includes the overlap of the areas of rat population such that the areas included in the overlap have the highest value. In other words the maximal point is in the vicinty of the rat definitely. even forget that what we can focus on is the fact that the maximal point will definitely lie in one of rectangles described by the populations because the maximal point is defined as the one which affects the largest rat pop hence must lie in at least one of the rect. Hence our search space shrinks to the N d^2 rects i.e 2*10^4*25*10^2 = 50 * 10^6 doable. So do it idiot :P
